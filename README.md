# Overview

![Description of the image](https://github.com/awais922609/Can-Bus-Hacking/blob/main/2.png)

This repository contains my implementation of the research paper [**Car-Hacking:Accessing-and-Exploiting-the-CAN-Bus-Protocol**](https://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=jcerp) by Bryson R. Payne. The project involves hacking automobiles using CAN bus messages. CAN (Controller Area Network) Bus is widely used in modern vehicles, and understanding its vulnerabilities is critical for both cybersecurity professionals and automotive engineers.

# Features

Packet Sniffing: Guidance on capturing and analyzing CAN Bus traffic.

Replay Attacks: Instructions on sending recorded packets back to the bus.

Packet Injection: Tips for crafting custom packets and injecting them into the network.

Message Decoding: Information on interpreting common CAN Bus messages.

Reverse Engineering: Steps for identifying unknown message IDs.

Automation Techniques: Suggestions for automating repetitive tasks in CAN Bus analysis.

# Requirements
