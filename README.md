# CAN Bus Hacking Project
This repository contains my implementation of the research paper [**Car-Hacking:Accessing-and-Exploiting-the-CAN-Bus-Protocol**](https://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=jcerp) by Bryson R. Payne. The project involves hacking automobiles using CAN bus messages.

# Installation
#### Clone the repository
#### Run the videos to see how things are moving around.

# Usage
Connect to the CAN bus network of the target automobile
Run the program to start sending CAN messages
Analyze the response messages to identify any vulnerabilities

# Results
By implementing the research paper, I was able to successfully hack into the target automobile and control its systems through CAN bus messages.<br/> The project highlights the potential vulnerabilities in the automotive industry and the need for increased security measures.
